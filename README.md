# Task-Killer

Built a script in Python that terminates all instances of a Streamlit app that you may run locally on your machine. Sometimes, when re-running Streamlit even when closing the browser of choice, it would add another instance called "Pythonw.exe" in Task Manager. The issue was that if you did this enough times, the app you are creating would no longer open, due to too many instances in Task Manager. The only solution was to go to Task Manager and manually end each task that was labeled "Pythonw.exe". When executed, this script does all of this automatically for you on the backend without you having to touch anything. This issue of multiple instances of "Pythonw.exe" was only created when trying to make your dashboard that you created with Streamlit as a standalone app (an .exe) using pynsist.
